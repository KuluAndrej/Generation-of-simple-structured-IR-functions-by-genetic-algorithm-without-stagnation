# Generation-of-simple-structured-IR-functions-by-genetic-algorithm-without-stagnation

In this project I implemented a genetic algorithm to generate ranking models. This algorithm is also aimed at outperforming the
exhaustive approach. In this project I partially solved the problems of overfitting and evolutionary stangation. The resulted 
selected superpositions are uniformly better than ones selected by the exhaustive approach.

The project is a part of the scientific paper of the same name.

# Computational expertiment

This project contains files, which allows to reproduce the results reflected in the paper.
The data collected to plot Figures 4-7 are in the 'report' folder.
To generate ranking functions with selected metric and regularizer, launch 'main.m' file.
It will also store values of empirical diameter for the chosen regularizer.

For additional explanations you can see some comments in corresponging files.
